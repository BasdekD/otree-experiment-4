    <p>You allocated <b>{{player.personal_account_ap}} Action Points</b> to your personal account.</p>
    <p><b>In this round, you {{ if not player.has_switched }}do not{{ endif }} move to the high-income group.</b></p>

    {{ if not player.has_switched }}
        <p>There are two possible reasons for this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Either because <b> this round is not a moving round.<br/>
                Remember that according to low-income members of previous sessions, the probability that a randomly
                selected round is a moving round is around
                <span class="mobility">{{ if session.config.mobility == 'low' }}10%{{ else }} 50%{{ endif }}</span>.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                Or this is a moving round but <b>two other low-income members allocated more Action Points than you</b>
                to their personal account.
            </li>
        </ol>
