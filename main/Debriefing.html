    <p>
        The aim of this study is to investigate how people react in unequal distribution of resources. The existing
        literature points two different types of reactions. The collective ones when people try to improve the
        position of the group as whole and the individual one when people try to improve their own position. In this
        study we investigate the factors that might affect whether people opt to react either collectively or
        individually.

    <p>
        This study was indeed an interactive study where you and three other participants made real-time decisions
        as members of the low-income group. In each round, you received real feedback about the contributions of
        low-income members to the public pool and the resulting redistribution of income from the high-income to
        the low-income group.
    </p>
    <p>However, <b>this study included two aspects of deception.</b></p>
    <p>
        {{ if session.config.mobility == 'low' }}
            You were informed that according to participants in previous sessions the probability of moving to the
            high-income group is 10% <b>in each round.</b> Indeed, some participants of previous sessions stated that
            the probability is 10%. However, in reality, it was predetermined that there were two moving rounds
            out of the twelve rounds and the moving rounds were always the last two rounds.
        {{ else }}
            You were informed that according to participants in previous sessions the probability of moving to the
            high-income group is 50% <b>in each round.</b> Indeed, some participants of previous sessions stated that
            the probability is 50%. However, in reality, it was predetermined that there were three moving rounds
            out of the twelve rounds and the moving rounds were always the last three rounds.
        {{ endif }}
        The reason for this arrangement is that we were interested in how you would respond in the first
        {{ if session.config.mobility == 'low' }} ten {{ else }} nine {{ endif }} rounds after repeatedly receiving
        feedback of not moving to the high-income group.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, you were informed that you were randomly assigned to either a low-income or high-income group.
        However, the high-income group did not really exist, and <b>all participants were assigned to the low-income
        group.</b> The reason for this deception aspect is that this study focuses on how members of the low-income
        group react to inter-group inequality.
